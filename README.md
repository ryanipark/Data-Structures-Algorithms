Brief description of programs:
(For an in depth view, please see the readme within the invidual directory)

## 01. Matrix multiplication
  Program utilizes a vector of vectors, allowing to multiply matrices. The program reads input for matrix A and B from a file, multiplies and displays result to user.
## 02. Linear and Binary search
  This program randomly generates integers and stores them in a vector, it uses STL's sort() from <algorithim> on the vector,then uses linear and binary search to find percent of successful searches. 
## 03. Template Stack and Queue
  This program tests and utilizes two queue's in a template class that simulates a stack.
## 04. Recursion using List
  This program solves the iconic josephus problem using STL's list. 
## 05. Stack and Deque
  This program simulates a parking garage that has 10 parking spaces. The vehicles are stored in a deque, one side represents entry, other represents exit. If a vehicle needs to leave with vehicles in front of it, the stack is used to count number of cars that needed to move. Very simple concept, yet fun implementing.
## 06. Map, pairs and Lambda
  This program takes in an input of words, cleans them of punctuation and capitilization then adds it to a map, essentially it will count the amount of times a word is used using the pair <string,int>, printing results to user. 
## 07. Binary Tree
  This program tests an implemented template Binary Tree class. All member functions are implmeented with the intention of keeping privacy from derived classes when accessing the base class Binary tree.
## 08. Binary Search Tree
  This program tests the implementation of a binary search tree as a derived class of 07, Binary tree. Along with inheritance the full template class of the BST was self implemented.
## 09. Separate chaining hash table
  This program uses a hash table implemnted with an STL vector that allows for creation/search/print/and sort of items in the hash table. It will take input from a file, constructing a hash table, then search for key matches in the table, printing results accordingly.
## 10. Simplegraph
  This program was to test a simple implementation of a graph, It simply displays the adjaceny list of the graph then shows a Depth-First traversal
